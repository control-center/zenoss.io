      <h1>Zenoss Control Center</h1>




      <p>Control Center is an application management and orchestration system (internally referred to at Zenoss as the control plane). Control Center can not only manage the Zenoss platform but other Docker applications, from a simple web application to a multi-tiered stateful application stack.</p>


      <h2><img src="/assets/ss.png"><br>Control Center Host Performance Monitoring</h2>

      <p>Control Center is based on a service orientated architecture which enables applications to run as a set of distributed services that can span hosts, datacenters and geographic regions. A simple declarative application template file is used to describe how an application is configured, deployed, management and monitored.</p>

      <h2><img src="/assets/flow.png"><br>Application Topology View - ELK Stack</h2>
      <p>Monitoring anything and everything is part of our DNA here at Zenoss, so we have built declarative monitoring support into Control Center. Applications can be automatically monitored and modeled upon provisioning.</p>

      <ul>Control Center key features:
          <li>Intuitive HTML5 user interface for application deployment and management</li>
          <li>Application topology visualization - know where your apps are and how they are connected</li>
          <li>Automated application discovery, configuration, deployment and availability monitoring</li>
          <li>Application multi-instance and distributed host support</li>
          <li>Integrated backup/restore and incremental snapshot/rollback support</li>
          <li>Simple to manage and deploy application templates for rapid application provisioning</li>
          <li>Built-in application logging via Elasticsearch</li>
          <li>Resource based Application service scheduler - schedule based on available resources across one or many hosts at runtime</li>
          <li>Stateful application support which includes support for database services and other persistent services</li>
          <li>Transparent SSL transport encryption across all application services/containers</li>
          <li>REST based API for easy integration into other management tools</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Contributing</h1>

      <p>The Control Center project aims to build a great community that builds software needed to deploy, manage, monitor and scale enterprise applications. We rely on several open source projects:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Docker & Docker Registry for deploying and managing containers.</li>
          <li>OpenTSDB & HBase for storing/querying performance data</li>
          <li>Elasticsearch & Logstash for domain data and logs</li>
          <li>Zookeeper for cluster coordination</li>
          <li>AngularJS, Bootstrap, and nvd3.js for UI</li>
          <li>Linux kernel for NFS, Btrfs, and cgroups</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Over time we hope that our project can incorporate some of the technology of other Docker-based orchestrators and vice/versa.</p>

      <p><strong>Discussions</strong><br>
      Many of the developers of the control center can be found on on #zenoss on IRC. You can also raise issues on github or post questions to the Zenoss forums.</p>

      <p><strong>Report Issues</strong><br>
      You can raise issues on Zenoss Control Center JIRA project. Zenoss uses JIRA internally to drive development, QA and customer issues.</p>
