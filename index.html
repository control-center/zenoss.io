      <h1>Contributing</h1>

      <p>The Control Center project aims to build a great community that builds software needed to deploy, manage, monitor and scale enterprise applications. We rely on several open source projects:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Docker & Docker Registry for deploying and managing containers.</li>
          <li>OpenTSDB & HBase for storing/querying performance data</li>
          <li>Elasticsearch & Logstash for domain data and logs</li>
          <li>Zookeeper for cluster coordination</li>
          <li>AngularJS, Bootstrap, and nvd3.js for UI</li>
          <li>Linux kernel for NFS, Btrfs, and cgroups</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Over time we hope that our project can incorporate some of the technology of other Docker-based orchestrators and vice/versa.</p>
